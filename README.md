# System Software

Welcome to the **System Software** repository! This repository contains various system software programs implemented in **C**. These programs demonstrate concepts in operating systems and system-level programming, including process scheduling, disk scheduling, memory management, and assembly language processing.

## Programs Included

This repository includes the following programs:

### 1. **Two Pass Assembler**
   - A simple two-pass assembler that converts assembly language code into machine code.
   - Generates a symbol table (`symtab.txt`) as part of the assembly process.

### 2. **Banker's Algorithm**
   - An implementation of the **Banker's Algorithm** used for deadlock avoidance in operating systems.
   - Ensures that resources are allocated in a way that avoids deadlock, based on available resources and maximum requirements of each process.

### 3. **CPU Scheduling**
   - A program for **CPU Scheduling** that simulates scheduling algorithms.
   - It may include popular algorithms such as **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**, **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**, or **Round Robin (RR)**.

### 4. **Disk Scheduling**
   - A program for **Disk Scheduling** that simulates disk access scheduling algorithms.
   - It may include algorithms like **FCFS**, **SSTF**, and **SCAN**.
